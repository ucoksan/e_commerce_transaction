# An Assignment for Python Model covers Data Cleaning & Preparation, EDA and Clustering Analysis

## Situation/ Case Background
Gustavo just started an e-commerce startup based in Portugal that recently open an online website to sell their product. Fortunately, Gustavo is launching their website when the covid-19 hits and making them grow faster than ever. However, Gustavo is still not using targeted marketing which hurts their marketing budget as only a fraction of their user comes back to their website. Gustavo needs your help to increase their marketing conversion rate by doing more targeted marketing using customer segmentation so that it will not hurt their budget.

* Removing duplicate values
* Handling Outliers
* Converting data types
* Combine the dataset into single dataset

**2. EDA consist of:**
* Evaluate descriptive statistics and provide the insight

  * Number of orders per month
  * Daily orders trend (which day of week is the busiest)
  * Percentage of orders per payment type
